Data-Driven Healthcare: SQL Queries for Effective Patient Management

This project demonstrates the practical use of SQL queries to efficiently manage and analyze healthcare data.
The dataset contains detailed information about patients, appointments, doctors, medical records, and health articles, allowing for in-depth exploration of various SQL concepts such as:
Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
Subqueries (Correlated and Non-Correlated)
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Data Filtering and Sorting


Key Objectives:
Analyze patient demographics and medical history to provide actionable insights.
Identify trends in appointment bookings, cancellations, and treatments.
Optimize data retrieval for healthcare professionals and health article management.
Explore how SQL can support decision-making in a clinical setting through effective data management.
